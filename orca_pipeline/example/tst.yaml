steps:
  - OPT           # Geometry Optimization
  - NEB_TS        # Nudged Elastic Band - Transition State
  - TS            # Transition State Optimization
  - IRC           # Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate
  - CONF          # Confomere search (takes either IRC end points or OPTimized structure as input)
  - SP            # Single Point Calculation

#- NEB_CI        # Nudged Elastic Band - Climbing Image
# Molecular Properties
charge: 0              # Total charge of the molecule/reaction
mult: 1                # Multiplicity (e.g., singlet = 1, doublet = 2)
solvent:               # If empty gas-phase

# Computational Settings
Nimages: 8            # Number of images for NEB calculations
method: r2scan-3c      # Computational method for geometry optimizations
sp_method: r2scan-3c   # Computational method for single point calculations. 

# Naming
name: DA       # Optional name for the system. If not provided, defaults based on filenames.

# Slurm Parameters
# SLURM parameters for jobs requiring lower memory resources
slurm_params_low_mem:
  nprocs: 24            # Number of processors
  maxcore: 2000        # Maximum core memory in MB

# SLURM parameters for jobs requiring higher memory resources
slurm_params_high_mem:
  nprocs: 24            # Number of processors
  maxcore: 3500       # Maximum core memory in MB

# Coordinate Files
# List of file paths to coordinate files. Depending on the number of files, the pipeline determines the type of calculation.
# - 1 file: Single molecule optimization
# - 2 files: Reaction without transition state
# - 3 files: Reaction with transition state
coords:
  - educt.xyz     # Coordinate file for the reactant (educt) 
  # - product.xyz   # Coordinate file for the product    
  #  - path/to/ts.xyz        # (Optional) Coordinate file for the transition state

# Additional Settings
fast: false               # Optional boolean to toggle fast NEB calculations (e.g., for methods not starting with "xtb")
zoom: false               # Optional boolean to toggle ZOOM-NEB-CI methods
dif_scf: false             # Optional boolean sets settings for tough to converege wavefunctions (currently only for OPT) 
conf_method: GOAT         ## Options are GOAT or CREST. GOAT should be prefered.  GOAT will alway use xtb2 currently 
cosmo: false              ## Calcualtes sovation free energy with COSMO_RS. Only for the SP step
